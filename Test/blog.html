                    <p>Yesterday, a post I had submitted to Hacker News got pushed up to the front
                       page. Outside of retiring and basking in my new-found internet fame, I wanted 
                       to show what a few hours on the front-page looks like.</p>

                    <p>One of my lockdown projects was to make my sit?stand controller smart.
                       I used a Raspberry Pi to create a custom controller that could control
                       the motor on my desk and alow me to rise and lower it over the network
                       as well as via touch-interface.

                    <h2>Sending Ember actions down to components</h2>
                    <p>"Data down,actions up" is an often repeated mantra of the Ember
                        community, and for good reason. Some times though, you need to call actions on components in a "downward" direction. In this 
                        post I'll give you an approach for breaking this DDAU rule.

                    <h2>"Route variable" pattern with Ember</h2>
                    <p>There are couple of different libraries for Ember that add the ability to set the page  title for each
                        page in your application by simply creating a 'title' property on each route. This is a great purpose pattern for declarative information that needs to be set across routes.
                        For example you might want to add breadcrumbs, or just a different heading on each page.
                        This post will outline how to go about creating this pattern yourself.
